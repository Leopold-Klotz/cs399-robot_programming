- Code taken from this tutorial: https://deepgram.com/learn/python-speech-recognition-locally-torchaudio
- For MacOS:
    - ffmpeg -g avfoundation -list_devices true -i dummy # to list all available devices
    - StreamReader(src = ":1", format = "avfoundation") # to use the device with index 1 ("macbook pro microphone")
- For Windows:
    - ffmpeg -f dshow -list_devices true -i dummy # to list all available devices
    - StreamReader(src = "audio=@device_cm_{33D9A762-90C8-11D0-BD43-00A0C911CE86}\wave_{BF2B8AE1-10B8-4CA4-A0DC-D02E18A56177}", format = "dshow") # to use the device with the name "Microphone (Realtek Audio)" (alternative name)
- Not currently fully functional.
